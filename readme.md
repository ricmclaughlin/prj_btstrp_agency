This project is a walk through of the Agency Landing Page Using LESS of [Udemy's Projects in Bootstrap](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/learn/#/). 

This project was supposed to be created using non-tooled starter template but I used the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) generator via [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and lots of [Bower]() packages.

supposed to be Less; Rewrote this is Sass.

This project is part of my [portfolio](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_btstrp_agency).
